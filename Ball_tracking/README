This collection of scripts sets up a DragonBoard 410c and rebuilds the kernel.
The purpose of seting up the board and rebuilding the kernel is to allow you to make changes to the kernel and enable additional features such as digital mics, camera mezzanine boards, and SPI devices.

These scripts have been tested against the 17.06.1 kernel (tested around August 10th, 2017). It should be noted that even if you are running against the same version, the infrastructure (all of the non-kernel parts of the Debian release) are constantly evolving, just doing a "sudo apt-get-update" will bring in newer versions of many packages. Some of the newer versions may break things in the scripts, so please don't expect these scripts to run flawlessly forever.

To run the scripts you need to add a SDCard to the system, format the SDCard with an ext4 file system, then create a directory on the SDCard called 'workspace'.
	# insert a SDCard (16GB or larger) into the slot on the Dragonboard
	sudo gdisk /dev/mmcblk1
		o - erase the partition table
		n - create a new partition, accept all of the defaults to make the entire SDCard a ext4 partition.
		w - write out the new partition table
	sync
	sudo reboot now # you need to reboot to get the SDCard properly recognized
	sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1
	cd /media/linaro/<long-name>
	sudo mkdir workspace
	sudo chown linaro.linaro workspace
	cd


Then symbolicly link the workspace on the SDCard to a directory called 'workspace' in the home directory.
	ln -s /media/linaro/<big long string>/workspace workspace
	cd workspace

Connect to the internet either through WiFi, or by using a USB to Ethernet dongle. Then determine your ip address.
	ip addr

Copy the scripts from your host computer into the workspace:
	scp scripts.tgz linaro@<ip addr>:~/workspace

Then on the target system unpack the scripts
	cd ~/workspace
	tar -vzxf scripts.tgz

Next run the scripts starting with a number, starting at 0 and working up, you need to run the 0 to 2 scripts to setup the system. The 3, 4 and 5 scripts are only needed if you want to run the cameras on the Camera Mezzanine boards. The 3,4,5 scripts take about 4 hours to run, they do a lot of stuff.
	./0-create-swapfile
	./1-system-update
	./2-system-setup
	./3-install-dlib.sh
	./4-install-gstreamer.sh
	./5-install-opencv.sh

Now Build and install the operating system kernel. Run the A to I scripts. If you are building a different version, you will need to edit the B and C scripts. When running the D script you need to provide some parameters to describe what you are trying to change. It takes a little over an hour to run the A-I scripts. The A and F scripts take most of the time.
	./A-do-git-clone
	./B-do-checkout
	./C-do-get-skales
	./D-enable-camera -D
	./E-do-make-defconfig
	./F-do-make-kernel
	./G-do-make-devicetree
	./H-do-make-bootimage
	./I-do-install

If you have a camera attached, and you have rebuilt the kernel with camera support, then you can test the camera with the scripts in the Vision directory.
	cd Vision
	./do-setup-video-OV5640	# or one of the similar scripts depending on your setup
	python3 ball-tracking.py
